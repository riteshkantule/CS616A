## CS616 Human-Centered Computing

Welcome to the CS616 Human-Centered Computing repository. This repository contains three mini-projects designed to apply various data analysis and machine learning techniques in the context of human-centered computing. Each project focuses on a unique aspect of user interaction and data analysis.

## Mini Projects Overview

### 1. Analyzing Users' Browsing History
This project involves analyzing users' browsing history using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for clustering and extracting insights.

- **Objective**: To identify patterns and categorize browsing behaviors.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - LDA for topic modeling
  - Data preprocessing and visualization
- **Outcome**: Insights into user browsing habits and interests, grouped into clusters.

### 2. Movie Recommendation System
This project develops a recommendation system to suggest movies based on user preferences and viewing history.

- **Objective**: To provide personalized movie recommendations.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - Collaborative filtering
  - Content-based filtering
  - Hybrid recommendation algorithms
- **Outcome**: A functional recommendation system that enhances user experience by suggesting relevant movies.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets to gauge public opinion and sentiment trends.

- **Objective**: To analyze the sentiment of tweets and categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Sentiment analysis algorithms
- **Outcome**: A sentiment analysis tool that provides insights into public opinion on various topics.
